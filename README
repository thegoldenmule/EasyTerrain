Usage is very simple. This object has two distinct types of generation called circle hill and limited random. Using default settings, a two dimensional height map can be constructed like so:

var terrainGenerator = new GMTerrain();
var map = terrainGenerator.generate(GMTerrain.TYPE_CIRCLEHILL);

The following settings may be changed to allow for variations of each generation technique:

// settings for both types
width = 40;				// width of array
height = 40;			// depth of array
minimumHeight = 50;		// minimum value
maximumHeight = 500;	// maximum value

// specific to limited random
this.lr_maximumHeightIncrease = 60;	// the maximum difference between adjacent nodes in the map

// specific to circle hill
this.ch_numCircles = 15;			// the number of hills
this.ch_circleRadius = 20;			// the radius of the hills
this.ch_circleHeightIncrease = 80;	// the maximum height of the hills
